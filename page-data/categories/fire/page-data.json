Who wouldn't, right? Not having to worry about money for the rest of our lives. We'll be free to live the life we've always dreamed of. Travelling the world. Eating all kinds of food. Trying various kinds of work. Spending a lot of time with family and friends. Creating something useful, something beautiful. Helping those in need. And a thousand things more. Or at least getting rid of the stress from always not having enough. Right?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"FIRE"}}}
